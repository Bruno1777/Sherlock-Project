# Sherlock-Project
We tried to make an application to check if a source is credible or not. We wanted to make it in Java first but we couldn't figure out how

Python libraries used:
Requests: https://pypi.org/project/requests/
bs4 & BeautifulSoup: https://pypi.org/project/bs4/
grammarBot: https://pypi.org/project/grammarbot/
